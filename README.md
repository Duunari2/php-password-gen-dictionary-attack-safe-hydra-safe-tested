1. Dictionary attack proof.
2. Hashcat proof -tested on my own linux terminal and hashcat application to set the setup to correlate for given input. Output was buffer overflow so owned hashcat with this.
3. Rainbow tables are old method simon says, is it really that how? So there is more that 20TB needed space to even think of trying to start that kind of method to crack my passwordgenerator output.


Password generator with password and md5 output.
similar like on web engines store.

Simple password changer for recommended routine. There are 12 charachers on password. Takes very long on the bruteforcing attack method to guess this cpu created password to answer the correlation is very difficult. This is source code of the program to avoid foil hatting about logging. Site is anothersearchengine.dy.fi and github alias is Duunari2 there are these two options. Also gives md5 hash of password as output.

Thats for debugging the thing here is this is finished and ready to modify to better purpoises just let this here.

Pasted this from readme original.

To get other releases use the domain: anothersearchengine.dy.fi
