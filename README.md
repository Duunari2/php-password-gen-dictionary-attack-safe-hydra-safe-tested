# php-password-gen-dictionary-attack-safe-hydra-safe-tested
Password generator with password and md5 output.
similar like on web engines store.

Simple password changer for recommended routine. There are 12 charachers on password. Takes very long on the bruteforcing attack method to guess this cpu created password to answer the correlation is very difficult. This is source code of the program to avoid foil hatting about logging. Site is anothersearchengine.dy.fi and github alias is Duunari2 there are these two options. Also gives md5 hash of password as output.

Thats for debugging the thing here is this is finished and ready to modify to better purpoises just let this here.

Pasted this from readme original.

To get other releases use the domain: anothersearchengine.dy.fi
